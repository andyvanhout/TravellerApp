# TravellerApp
A Github repo for my home Mongoose Traveller 2nd Edition game. Right now it only does planet generation in UPP format (though I had and can restore a verbose format), and only barely in the command line using the Python interpreter. It also doesn't use the rules as stated in the book, because my flavor of campaign is different.
