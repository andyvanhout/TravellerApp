Planet Generator/Manager
- Most immediately I need a UPP generator for planets using my parameters.

Maximum TL 11/10
Population levels way lower depending on sector

Planet Characteristics
Size
- 0 through A (2D-2)
- Small populations on worlds smaller than 5
- Worlds of 0 or 1 are asteroids, orbital complexes, or space stations. Automatic Atmosphere of 0
- Low gravity for worlds size 6 or lower.  High gravity for worlds 10.

Atmosphere
- traveller rules is 2D-7 + Planet Size
- thinking about house ruling to random 0 through 15
- maybe think about weighed random depending on planet size.
- Size 0 or 1: Always Atmosphere 0.

Hydrographics
- traveller rules is 2D-7 + Atmosphere
- thinking about houseruling to random 0 through 10
- Size 0 or 1: Always Hydrographic 0
- Atmosphere 0, 1, A, B: DM-4

Temperature
- Not part of UPP, but can now be calculated randomly if desired.
- 2D with various DMs depending on atmosphere.

Population
- traveller rules 2D-2
- Once we have population and the previous states, trade codes can be calculated.
